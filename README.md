To install the necessary dependencies you must
execute the following scripts:
	installScript.sh

In order to run the application you must
execute the following scripts:
	runServer.sh
	grunt.sh

Then, all you have to do is to open index.html
in your favourite browser(mozilla firefox was
used during development).
